Hello. I'm a Master's student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/">Sebastian Scherer</a> in the <a href="https://theairlab.org">AirLab</a>. I am currently working on 3D perception for UAV and UGV in visually-degraded, outdoor environments. I am particularly interested in the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and robotics.

After my first year of graduate studies, I interned at <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, working on perception for offroad navigation. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine, where I worked with Prof. <a href="https://royf.org/">Roy Fox</a> in the <a href="https://indylab.org/">Intelligent Dynamics Lab</a> on semantic perception and sim2Real for vision-based reinforcement learning. During my undergrad, I also developed computer vision applications at the UCI <a href="https://www.caidm.som.uci.edu/">Center for Artificial Intelligence in Diagnostic Medicine</a> and USC <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/">Energy Efficient Secure Sustainable Computing Group</a>.
